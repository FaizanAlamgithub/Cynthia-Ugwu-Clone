# Cynthia-Ugwu-Clone
## I have cloned Cynthia Ugwo’s innovative web application designed for learning purpose. This project focuses on providing users with a sleek, user-friendly interface to track their expenses and manage their budgets effectively. My objective was to replicate the core functionality of the original while incorporating my own design elements and improvements.

### Features
- Enhanced User Interface: I have reworked the UI to make it more intuitive and visually appealing.
- Customizable Dashboards: Users can now personalize their dashboards to fit their specific needs.
- Performance Improvements: Optimized the application for faster load times and smoother interactions.
### Technologies Used
- Html, Css, Gsap, Locomotive, Javascript

### Challenges and Learnings
-Cursor Flattening and Hover Effects: One of the significant challenges was implementing a cursor that becomes flat when the mouse moves, and enlarges while changing color when hovering over span and a tags. This involved:
  - Designing the Flat Cursor: Making the cursor flat on both axes during movement required precise scaling adjustments and smooth animations.
  - Hover Effects: Adjusting the cursor size and changing the text color on hover involved handling dynamic style changes effectively using CSS and JavaScript.
  - Implementation: Achieving a seamless transition between the flat cursor and its normal size while interacting with different elements required a combination of GSAP animations and 
  - responsive design techniques.
